# The root filesystem should have a pass number of either 0 or 1.
# All other filesystems should have a pass number of 0 or greater than 1.
#
# NOTE: If your BOOT partition is ReiserFS, add the notail option to opts.
#
# See the manpage fstab(5) for more information.
#
# Notes 
#  auto/noauto:  Specify whether the partition should be automatically mounted on boot.  i
#  You can block specific partitions from mounting at boot-up by using “noauto”.
#
#  noatime. If this option is set for a file system in /etc/fstab, then reading accesses will 
#  no longer cause the atime information (last access time ) that each read access will not result
#  in a write operation. Therefore, using noatime can lead to significant performance gains.
#
#  sw -- swapon -a ( All devices marked as ''swap'' in /etc/fstab are made available, except for those with the ''noauto'' option
#
#  This field sets whether the backup utility dump will backup file system. If set to "0" file system ignored, "1" file system
#  is backed up.  Dump is seldom used and if in doubt use 0.
#
#  Pass (fsck order) -- Fsck order is to tell fsck what order to check the file systems, if set to "0" file system is ignored.
#  Often a source of confusion, there are only 3 options :
#
#	0 == do not check.
#	1 == check this partition first.
#	2 == check this partition(s) next
