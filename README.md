This allow the avoidance of putting extra libraries on the system that I would never use or may not want after testing.
  * A closely related reason, but separate in mind, is I would to have a place where I can install a package and either verify that packages works or decide if I want to install a package on my primary machine or use a continar or perhaps a flatpack to run the package.  An example would be hadoop
  * To simulate a distributed environment where I have more than one machine.  An example use case could be microservice projects.
