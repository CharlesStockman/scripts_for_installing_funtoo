## Use Cases

The script are bhttps://github.com/CharlesStockman/installing_funtooe created for the following envisioned use cases.

* For the creation of virtual mahcine
  * When I started in Linux, I always tried different window managers, a virtual machine would allow to study window managers again without using my primary harddrive and installing packages that I do not want ofr the long term
  * A closely related reason, but separate in mind, is I would to have a place where I can install a package and either verify that packages works or decide if I want to install a package on my primary machine or use a continar or perhaps a flatpack to run the package.  An example would be hadoop
  * To simulate a distributed environment where I have more than one machine.  An example use case could be microservice projects.
